# RocketProject
A project to design and analyze my own liquid propellant rocket. This includes laying out the operational envelope, creating a Python code to analyze combustion characteristics and predict propulsion performance, designing and analyzing on a component level as well as assembled as a unit all while documenting the entire process for the future.
